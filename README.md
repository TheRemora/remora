# Remora - NFT's Redefined

### What is Remora?

Remora is a kind of fishes which spend most of their lives clinging to a host animal such as a whale, turtle, shark or ray. They remove ectoparasites for the host in order to receive their protection.

This story inspires our team to apply in the modern art industry. Nowadays, one product could be modularized and included in another bigger projects. This win-win relationship should be empowered by Blockchain technology where all contributors could be transparently paid for their influence.
